# Calendar App

# Overview

Many scheduling tools are complex and hard to use either the UI or UX, the most important feature of the calendar app is to get the information quickly when we need it. The calendar is minimal distractions and smooth for daily use. Thinking about what is most straightforward and what is the instinctive information that we look for. Itâ€™s more challenging if the user can customize the outlook of it and also provide much useful information.
